# GitHub-Dashboard-For-Pillar



To Run Front End: http-server . (from root dir)

To Run Server: node app.js (from src dir)
Note: The server has a bug currently and thus the front end is hooked directly into Github until the bug is fixed.



Bug details: The node server does not recognize the function of an imported controller object. This may have to do with an ES6 vs ES5 issue with respect to exporting functions.
